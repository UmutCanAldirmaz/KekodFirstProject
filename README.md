Android Switch & Bottom Navigation Project
This Android project showcases a dynamic user interface with a set of six switches and a bottom navigation bar. The application demonstrates handling switch states and updating the bottom navigation bar accordingly. Here's a summary of its key features:

Features
Switch Management:

Six switches are available, including a special "Ego" switch.
When the "Ego" switch is on, the other switches become disabled and unclickable.
When the "Ego" switch is off, the other switches are enabled and clickable.
Bottom Navigation Bar Integration:

The bottom navigation bar displays items based on the state of the switches.
Each switch corresponds to a navigation item. When a switch is toggled, the item is added or removed from the bottom navigation bar.
Clicking on a navigation item changes the fragment displayed in the fragment container.
The back button navigates through the fragments in the order they were opened.
Dynamic Fragment Handling:

Fragments are dynamically added and replaced based on navigation item selection.
Proper lifecycle management ensures smooth transitions and state handling.
UI Design:

A visually appealing layout with a modern design.
Custom colors and styles are used to enhance user experience.
